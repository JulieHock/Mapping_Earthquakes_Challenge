# Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge
  

## Overview

When you visit this site, you will be able to choose several different options for your map.  The options are either a street map, satellite map, or a dark map.  Once you choose the map of your choice, you can then select the type of earthquake data you would like to see.  The options are to see earthquakes, techtonic plate lines, or major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 5).  You could also view any combination of the three earthquake options, or only one.
